# Installation
:::{note}
SciBmad runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
:::

SciBmad is written in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/), and we
generally recommend using Julia for the best experience. If you are new to Julia, these
resources might be helpful:

- [MATLAB-Python-Julia Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheets.quantecon.org/)
- [Julia wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introducing_Julia)
- [ThinkJulia (for those new to programming)](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html)

First, Julia must be installed. To do so, follow the platform-dependent
[installation instructions here](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup). `juliaup` is a
Julia version manager that makes it easy to install and use new stable Julia versions as
they become available. **We highly recommend using the long term support (LTS) channel of Julia with SciBmad. This can be set in the terminal after installing `juliaup` using the command:**

```
juliaup add lts
juliaup default lts
```

After the Julia installation, run `julia` and add the `SciBmad` package with the command:
```julia
import Pkg; Pkg.add("SciBmad")
```

This may take around 10-20 minutes to compile and install.

## Updating SciBmad

To update SciBmad, and any other Julia packages you have, in Julia run

```julia
import Pkg; Pkg.update()
```

## Plotting

Julia has various plotting packages you may add as well, including
[Makie](https://docs.makie.org/stable/) and [Plots](https://docs.juliaplots.org/stable/).
Our personal preference is Makie.

## Julia Jupyter Kernel

A Jupyter kernel for Julia can be installed using the [IJulia](https://ijulia.org/stable/) package. We recommend running this kernel installation command in Julia, which will enable multithreading and automatically use the global project environment:

```julia
import Pkg; Pkg.add("IJulia")
using IJulia
IJulia.installkernel("Julia Global", env=Dict("JULIA_NUM_THREADS"=>"auto"), "--project=$(Base.active_project())")
```
Then when Jupyter is opened, the Julia kernel will appear as an option.

## Using SciBmad from Python

Python users can use SciBmad via the [PySciBmad](https://github.com/bmad-sim/PySciBmad)
Python interface package, currently in development. Julia can also be called directly
from Python using the [`juliacall` package](https://juliapy.github.io/PythonCall.jl/stable/juliacall/).

The [Examples](examples-index.md) section includes notebooks written in both Julia and
Python using `juliacall`.

:::{warning}
The Python interface to SciBmad is early in development.
