# Frequency Map Analysis

Frequency map analysis can be performed using the exported `naff` function, which accepts an
input array of `n_particles x n_samples`. The entire NAFF algorithm implemented in SciBmad is
fully GPU-vectorizable, and so NAFF can be performed in parallel on the GPU if the input
array is a `CUDA.CuArray`.
